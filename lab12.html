                        <h2>Recap</h2>
                        <p>In labs 1, 3-5, I built a working robot capabale of moving and sensing distance + orientation. In lab 2, I implemented debugging capabilities using BLE (bluetooth). In labs 6-8, I implemented closed loop control to get the robot to move a certain distance and rotate by a certain angle. In labs 9-11, the robot now had the ability to map its environment and localize itself within it. Using all of these features, the goal of lab 12 is to navigate through a set of waypoints in a map.<p>
                        <h2>Strategy</h2>
                        <p>The instructions for this lab was very open-ended, meaning that we had to come up with our own strategy for navigating around the map. First, the map that we had to navigate the robot around was the same map used in labs 9-11. The waypoints to navigate around are shown in the picture below:<p>

                        <p> The exact coordinates (in feet) of the way points are:<p>
                          <img class="img-fluid rounded mb-5" width="660" height="315" src="assets/img/lab 12/coordinates.png" alt="...">
                        <p>The big picture strategy was quite simple:<p>
                          <ol>
                            <li>Localize </li>
                            <li>Calculate the angle that the robot needs to turn by to face the next waypoint</li>
                            <li>Calculate the distance the robot needs to travel to the next waypoint</li>
                            <li>Rotate and then translate the robot</li>
                          </ol>
                        <p>To achieve this, I defined 4 functions in Arduino (mostly just putting code from previous labs into separate functions):
                          <ul>
                            <li>localize(): This function localizes the robot. Basically a copy-and-paste of the code from lab 11.</li>
                            <li>pid_pos(setpoint_pos): This function implements PID position control. Stops the robot at a distance equal to setpoint_pos from the wall it's facing.</li>
                            <li>pid_ori(setpoint_ori): This function implements PID orientation control. Rotates the robot by an angle equal to setpoiint_ori.<p>
                            <li>move_distance(dist): This function moves the robot by a distance equal to dist. If dist > 0, it moves the robot forward. If dist < 0, it moves the robot backward. This function makes use of the function pid_pos(setpoint_pos).
                        <p>The actual code for the functions are below:<p>
                          <script src="https://gist.github.com/apark2459/60a57746316e8a58330a09c71e596ee1.js"></script>
                        <h2>Testing Functions</h2>
                        <p>Then the next step I took was to test these functions. Here are videos of the robot turning 120 degrees and 330 degrees using the pid_ori(setpoint_ori) function:<p>

                        <p>Next, I tested the move_distance(dist) function. Here are videos of the robot moving 50 cm forward, 100 cm forward, 100 cm backward as marked by the green tape on the floor:<p>
                          <iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://youtube.com/embed/i1ACBPNwnrk" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
                          <iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://youtube.com/embed/eJzon7E7KUY" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
                          <iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://youtube.com/embed/faEbH9VBqUA" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
                        <p>One observation I made was that as dist increases, the steady error (actual distance traveled - dist) increases. So I needed to adjust for this later when I executed the navigation task. Also, there was no need to test pid_pos(setpoint_pos) separately because it's gets called in move_distance(dist) and because this function works pretty well, I knew that pid_pos(setpoint_pos) worked pretty well. Also, since I had done localization the week before, I didn't feel a need to test localize() and decided to move onto the next task.
                        <h2>Navigation Using PID Control</h2>
                        <p>Before using localization to perform navitgation, I decided to try to navigate the waypoints using PID control only (i.e. using pid_ori and move_distance only). The robot would start facing rightwards. One immediate problem I ran into was that when the robot tried to get from the first waypoint to the second waypoint, the wall it was facing would be over 3.4 m. One issue with the TOF sensor that we were given is that it gives very unreliable readings when the distance it was measuring is very far. Because the TOF readings were very inaccurate, this caused PID position control to be very inaccurate. When Anya saw me having this issue, she suggested that I rotate my robot 180 degrees so that it was facing the wall behind it which was a lot closer (less than 1 meter), leading to accurate TOF readings. This was a really good idea and it worked. With that in mind, the algorithm for navigation using PID control was the following:<p>
                          <ul>
                            <li>1→2: Turn 45 degrees, turn 180 degrees,  go backwards 0.862104586 meters, turn 180 degrees</li>
                            <li>2→3: Turn 315, go straight 0.9144 meters</li>
                            <li>3→4: Turn 310 degrees, go straight 0.681553520304 meters</li>
                            <li>4→5: Turn 60 degrees, go straight 0.9144 meters</li>
                            <li>5→6: Turn 90 degrees, go straight 0.3048 meters</li>
                            <li>6→7: Go straight 1.524 meters</li>
                            <li>7→8: Turn 90 degrees, go straight 1.524 meters</li>
                            <li>8→9: Turn 90 degrees, go straight 0.9144 meters</li>
                          </ul>
                          <br>
                        <p>Translated into code, the algorithm looks like the following:<p>
                          <script src="https://gist.github.com/apark2459/82ba58b35ecc1d36f52443fe84ba85d8.js"></script>
                        <p>This method worked surprisingly well. Having a robus PID controller for both position and orientation made things a lot easier. The following is a video of a successful naviation attempt:<p>
                          <iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://youtube.com/embed/6JesuqYJEfY" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
                        <p>An honest note: I didn’t expect it to fully work the 3rd attempt so I didn’t record it from the start...In the next attempt, it worked up to the 4th waypoint but got stuck on one of the walls afterwards. So I merged the two videos together. But I swear it did naviagte successfully through all of the waypoints on the 3rd attempt!<p>
